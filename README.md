Hello all, my name is Zhi Wei. Currently I am a graduate of Ngee Ann Polytechnic. 
# Languages
I am current in a few languages, that is **Python**, **C#**, and **TypeScript/JavaScript**. But am trying to learn these few languages below.
1. C
2. C++
3. Java
4. Perl
5. Rust
# Upcoming projects
Here are some of my projects and upcoming concepts. (Put on Hold) 
1. Tinkering with C and maybe packet capture, then put it into TensorFlow (a bit tough)
2. My idea of a SmartCube, powered by an ESP32 that speaks and (hopefully) has voice recognition.
3. USB to SATA adapter, that has additional power via USB PD.
